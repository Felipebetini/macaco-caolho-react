                      browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate
                      and set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add
                      pimentón, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and
                      pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and
                      fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add saffron broth and
                      remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.
